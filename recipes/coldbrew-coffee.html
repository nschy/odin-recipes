    <h1>Cold Brew Coffee</h1>

    <p>Coffee brewed slowly in cold water is less acidic than hot brewed. You can use this concentrate straight over ice or microwave half a mug coffee and then add a half cup of boiling water for quick hot coffee. Develop your own ratio of coffee to water for your custom brew.

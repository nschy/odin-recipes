    <h1>Chicken Nachos</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken-nachos.jpg" alt="Loaded Chicken Nachos">
    <p>Super-simple but totally killer nachos! These are to die for with some guacamole, sour cream and salsa. If it's too spicy for you, just leave out the cayenne.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package corn tortilla chips, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican-style cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) can diced green chilies, drained</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the chicken, vegetable oil, and cayenne pepper. Let stand for 15 minutes, or longer if desired.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken mixture, and fry until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread a thin layer of tortilla chips in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle 1/4 of the chicken, 1/4 of the chilies, and 1/4 of the cheese over the chips. Repeat layers ending with cheese on the top.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is melted and everything is heated through. Serve with your favorite nacho toppings.</li>
    </ol>
